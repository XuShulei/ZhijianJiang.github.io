title: GRE Experience
subtitle: Say Goodbye to GRE! Let's ROCK!!!

Luckily, I got 154 (Verbal) + 168 (Quantitive) = 322 the first time I took GRE and I spent about 1 month **totally** on GRE.   
Maybe some of my ideas and experience would help you!   

## Prerequisite   
* (site)[GRE考满分](https://gre.kmf.com): A very powerful site and it is totally free!!!
    
* (video)[陈琦GRE核心词汇考法精析授课视频](http://pan.baidu.com/share/link?shareid=1474389679&uk=187904928), [模范笔记](http://pan.baidu.com/share/link?shareid=2977542224&uk=187904928)

Practicing is much more than completing questions. So, **make notes** when needed!   
When GRE is coming, **reviewing notes** is the main task!
