## Writing
My TOEFL writing development: 19 -> 24 -> 27 -> 29   
Let's beat WRITING in 30 minutes!!   
**Note**: Use enough **link words**!!!

**Sample question**: It is difficult for teachers to be both popular (students like them) and effective helping students in learning?   

### Head (**template**)   
* (1 sentence) Describe the **background**:   
With the development of ...
* (1 sentence) point out the **issue**:   
So, whether to ... has ignited a heated debated among the public.   
* (2 sentences) Talk about **two opinions**:   
**For some**, they think that teachers have difficulty in making students like them as well as helping students in learning effectively.    
**For others**, it is possible for teachers to keep popular and teach students at the same time.   
**Note**: 用**两种方式**陈述正反方观点，无需陈述理由，好处：1.快。2.讲的清楚。3.字多。   
* (1 sentence) Point out your own **standpoint clearly**:   
(**RIGHT!!!**)**Personally**, I support the first opinion that teachers could find some ways to winning popularity from students as well as teaching them properly.   
**Note**: You should **clearly** point out your viewpoint   
instead of    
(**WRONG!!!**)Personally, I support the first/second opinion.   
* (1 sentence) Plus, a polite formula:   
In the following paragraphs, I would give some explanations to clarify my viewpoints.   

### Tail (**template**)
* (1-2 sentences) Conclude your supporting ideas:   
In brief, teachers could do both well if they idea1, idea2...   
* (1 sentence) Speak about your main opinion again!   
* (1 sentence) Improvements, in other words, a **nonsense**. There are three methods:   
    * Suggestion   
    * **Proof by contradiction**: If not ..., ...
    * **Cry out**: If only ... , ... **OR** Only if ... , ...

### Body (**Logic flow**)   
Usually, you should have **3** body paragraphs.   
About how to assign these three paragraphs, you could choose to claim 3 supporting ideas    
while I prefer to write **2 supporting ideas plus 1 concession paragraph** because   
* it is easy and quick to write concession paragraph
* it is easier to figure out 2 supoorting ideas rather than 3
Since concession paragraph is easier, talk about it first.   

#### Concession Paragraph (**template**)
* (1 sentence) Admit drawback: Admittedly, **a disadvantage of your main opinion**.   
* (1 sentence) Reject drawback at once: However, use a **simple** but solid reason to reject this drawback.   
* A formula: So, the opposing opinion cannot bear careful analysis and I still insist on my former viewpoint.   

#### Supporting Idea (**Logic Flow**)
Before writing this paragraph, you **must** be able to figure out at least 2 paragraphs in a short time. How to be equipped with this power? **Read others' opinions and practice many times!**   

##### At first
* (1 sentence) Point out your supporting idea **clearly, simply, directly**:    
**First/Second/...** , it would work if teachers could modify their teaching methods.   
**Note**: the most complex structure is main clause plus **1** subordinate clause.

##### Explain your idea
* (2-3 sentences) Explain your idea. **MOST IMPORTANT!!!** because
    * 2-3 sentences account for a large part of a paragraph
    * Decide how to build up your examples later, which could take up at most **2/3** of a paragraph!!!   
When it comes to how to explain your idea, I recommended a trick called **Bridging(搭桥法)**!

##### Bridging
* Simply, when you supporting idea is A results in B, you should find an agent C and then explain how A causes C as well as how C causes B.A -> C -> B
* There are more complex structures
    * A -> C -> D -> B
    *   -> C   
      A      -> B   
        -> D   
* Example: 
    * (A -> B) Helping others makes my community mor harmonious.
    * (A -> C) With more and more people inclined to help others in my community, many habitants' attitudes to neighbours become positive and friendly, more willing to show kindness.
    * (C -> B) As the trend of showing kindness to others sweeps through the community, the whole atmosphere becomes much more harmonious.

##### Example or comparison
* Your example must be based on your explanation before. In other words, you should use a story to say the **logic flow** again!
* About comparison, compare with the other opinion.
