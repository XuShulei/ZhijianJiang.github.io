title: ECE Deadlines Statistics
subtitle: Apply as soon as possible
---
## Motivation
In order to manage my application timetable, I do statistics on the number of schools on specific deadlines.   

## Notes
* Since it is largely likely for schools with late deadline to do rolling admission, this kind of school should not be applied by the deadline.
* A few schools may account for 2 times becasue of different deadlines of scholarship appliants, materials mails and so on.
* I only do statistics on ECE or EE or EECS or EE-related programs.
* According to USNEWS of some year, the general rank is to 72 while the major rank is to 52

## Graph
**Here is the result**:

## Conclusion
* **Dec 15** and **Jan 15** is definitely the peak of application deadlines, pay attention to these two days!

## Plus
Come one everyone in this tough but **EXCITING** application reason!!!
