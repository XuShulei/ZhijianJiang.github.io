title: ECE Deadlines Statistics
subtitle: Apply as soon as possible
---
## Motivation
In order to manage my application timetable, I do statistics on the number of schools on specific deadlines.   

## Notes
* Since it is largely likely for schools with late deadline to do rolling admission, this kind of school should not be applied by the deadline
* A few schools may account for 2 times becasue of different deadlines of scholarship appliants, materials mails or so on
* I only do statistics on ECE or EE or EECS or **EE-related** programs
* According to USNEWS rank of some year, the general rank is to **72** while the major rank is to **52**
* So stupid that I do it **by hand** (tiring..) without python, spider or something else.

## Graph
**Here is the result**:

![](/img/number-month.PNG)     

## Conclusion
* **Dec 15** and **Jan 15** are definitely the peak of application deadlines, pay attention to these two days!
* **Dec** and **Jan** are the decisive months. Going through two months is the future!!

## Plus
Come one everyone in this tough but **EXCITING** application season!!!
